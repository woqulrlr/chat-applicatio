# chat-application

Version 1
Build a chat application 
There are two basis component:
  1.server
  2.client

Version 2
Adding a GUI

Version 3
Combine server and client, now, we can only run chat.tcl. We can send and receive message. Before that, we must run LRserver.tcl and LRclient.tcl.

Version 4
Code a py server and deploy it on the VPS. Users computer only retain a client. In the other word, we don't create a TCL server socket. We just create a client socket. The py server on VPS will transmit u messages to other people.
